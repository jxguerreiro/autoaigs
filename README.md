## Example

> I’ve spent 31 YEARS working inside one of the BUSIEST veterinary clinics, and what I’ve seen over and over again is that most of the issues that quietly STEAL YEARS from a dog’s life are not solved with PRESCRIPTIONS.  
> They’re solved with CONSISTENT NUTRITION and SIMPLE daily adjustments at home.  
> Chronic ear problems almost always come from yeast and bacteria thriving because the gut is out of balance.
> A spoon of plain unsweetened yogurt a few times a week helps restore that balance from the inside.  
> Bad breath is often a digestion issue not just a dirty mouth.
> Fresh parsley mixed into meals acts like a natural deodorizer and soothes the stomach.  
> Dry cracked paw pads are common.
> Rubbing in a little coconut oil hydrates and heals without chemicals and it is safe even if the dog licks it.  
> Dogs that cannot relax at night often have low magnesium intake.
> Adding cooked spinach into meals provides natural calm and helps everyone sleep better.  
> If your dog keeps itching and scratching and biting especially in the belly area.
> Then this is probably due to flea bites or hidden ticks.  
> While most vets recommend chemical pesticides like collars pills or flea sprays these are actually known to cause long term kidney and liver damage to dogs.  
> The best way that I know to get rid of fleas and ticks is to use a water based natural solution.  
> You can make it at home or just buy a pre made concentrate.  
> My favorite lately has been this Bug M D essential oil concentrate that you mix with water and it kills fleas instantly.  
> It has no harsh chemicals for pets or people and it also lasts a long time.  
> If you are in the U S you can find it on Amazon but be warned I always see it selling out fast.  
> Follow for more real vet backed tips that keep your pets healthy and strong.
